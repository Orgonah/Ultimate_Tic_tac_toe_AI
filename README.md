ALPHA-BETA UTTT:
    Simply run the "alpha-bata.cpp" or "alpha-bata.exe" to work

    It's cpp cause alpha-beta needs to be fast and go in depth to work.
    I have created a simple heuristic function for it. it can see up to it's 10 next step and choose the best option using minimax.
    Without heuristic function can take millions of second to respond.
    GUI is with Reylib library.

MCTS:
    Simply run "play.py" to work

    this is a ML function for finding the best move. because of its formula it doesnt need to check every path of the tree. it can see up to it's 30 next step and choose the best option.
    GUI is with pygame.
